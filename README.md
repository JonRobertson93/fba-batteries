# FBA Battery-Free Chrome Extension
<h2> Introduction </h2>
This Chrome extension was created to help Amazon FBA sellers save time while submitting battery-free items.
<br />
<b> The problem: </b>
<br/>
Almost all items sent in to an Amazon warehouse to sell (FBA) require the user to submit information stating if the item contains batteries and if it is considered hazardous to dispose of.
There are so many sellers who this does not apply to - books, jewelry, grocery, etc... Since these don't have batteries, the sellers are spending a lot of time answering no to these same questions over and over.
<br />
<b> The solution: </b>
<br/>
Let JavaScript auto-answer these questions for the sellers! Once you get to the page on Amazon that asks the questions, the script auto-fills the form to say there are no batteries in the products and submits the form so the user can continue with their shipment to Amazon.
